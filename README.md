# Adidas-Sales-Insiight-Dashboard-Power-BI-
This project showcases data analysis and visualization skills using Power BI, based on an Adidas sales dataset from Kaggle.

The dataset includes details such as sales revenue, units sold, product categories, and geographic locations. Key analyses include sales trends, top-performing products, regional sales insights, and customer segmentation. The project demonstrates proficiency in data cleaning, transformation, and dashboard creation, providing actionable business intelligence insights to drive sales strategy and decision-making.

Problem Statement:

Adidas aims to optimize its sales strategy by gaining deeper insights into its sales performance across different regions, product categories, and customer segments. Currently, there is limited visibility into the key drivers of sales trends, regional performance variations, and the effectiveness of different product lines. The challenge is to identify patterns and actionable insights from the sales data that will help improve decision-making, increase revenue, and enhance the efficiency of marketing and inventory management.

This project seeks to solve this problem by leveraging a Power BI dashboard that provides a comprehensive analysis of Adidas' sales data. The dashboard will offer visual insights into overall sales performance, highlight top-selling products and regions, and uncover trends that can drive future sales strategies and improve competitive positioning.
